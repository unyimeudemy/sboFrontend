# Staff Behavioural Observation (SBO)

## Introduction

This project is a prototype of an online form for all staffs in GZ Idustries to report any issue.
It can be used for the following:

1. To commend a colleague on operations well performed.
2. To report colleagues not following safety rules.
3. To report faulty equipment to the management.
4. Acknowledge issues that have been addressed.

## Inspiration

The idea came while I was working as an HSE intern in GZI Aba plant Nigeria.
Our duty involved collecting all the reports and inputing into an excel sheet,
so I decided to create a platform to collecting this data any where, any time
and the people responsible can also access it any where without waiting for HSE team.

## Features

1. Submission of report (text, audio, video)
2. Getting back all the SBO filled by user on the user profile
3. People responsible for closing issues can filter data.

## Technologies

FRONTEND: Reactjs, styled components, redux-toolkit.
BACKEND: Nodejs, Expressjs, Mongodb
